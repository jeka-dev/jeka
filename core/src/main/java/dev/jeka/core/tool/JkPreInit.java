/**
 * Marks a static KBean method to run during KBean initialization.
 * The method must take one parameter: the KBean to pre-initialize.
 * <p>
 * It runs after the KBean is created but before properties or
 * command-line arguments are injected.
 * <p>
 * The method must be static and accept one argument of type KBean
 * or its subclass.
 * <p>
 * To be detected, the method must be within a KBean class involved in
 * the setup phase (a KBean declared with @myKBean= property, present
 * on the command line, or identified as the 'init' bean).
