Jeka features high-level and low-level classes to deal with Java builds and JVM concepts.

## Package `dev.jeka.core.api.java`

Base classes are used as a foundation for implementing Jeka high-level build API but they can be used directly in a low level build description.
These classes belong to `dev.jeka.core.api.java` [package](https://github.com/jerkar/jeka/tree/master/dev.jeka.core/src/main/java/dev/jeka/core/api/java).

* `JkClassLoader` and `JkUrlClassloader` wrap a `java.lang.ClassLoader` adding convenient methods and classpath scanning capability.
* `JkJarPacker` A simple utility to create a Jar or fat Jar file from compiled classes.
* `JkJavaCompiler` Wraps either a Java Compiler tool, or a *javac* process.
* `JkJavadocProcessor` A Java source processor producing standard Javadoc
* `JkJavaProcess` A utility to launch Java process (from class dirs or jars)
* `JkManifest` Stands for the manifest file to be included in jar files.

## Package `dev.jeka.core.api.j2e`

* `JkJ2eWarArchiver` : Provides methods to generate war files, including dependency jars.
* `JkJ2eWarProjectAdapter` : Helps to adapt an existing `JkProject` to make it generate _war_ artefacts_.

## Package `dev.jeka.core.api.kotlin`

* `JkKotlinCompiler` : Provides a means to get a suitable compiler according a given Kotlin version. This class also provides methods to 
  compile Kotlin sources in a fluent way.

* `JkKotlinModules` : Holds the constants for common Kotlin library coordinates.

## Package `dev.jeka.core.api.testing`

Jeka features a simple yet powerful API to launch tests. It relies entirely on JUnit5. This means that any test framework is supported by Junit5 platform.

Jeka testing API mostly hides *Junit Platform*. For most of the cases, you won't need to code
against *Junit-Platform* API to launch tests with Jeka. Nevertheless, Jeka allows users to
code against *Junit-Platform* for fine-tuning.

The API classes all belong to `dev.jeka.core.api.testing` [package](https://github.com/jerkar/jeka/tree/master/dev.jeka.core/src/main/java/dev/jeka/core/api/java/testing).

### `JkTestProcessor` 

This is the entry point to launch tests. Tests are executed using the current classloader classpath 
+ extra class path mentioned in `#launch` method arguments.
  
We can access `JkEngineBehavior` by `JkTestProcessor#getEngineBehavior()`. From there we can 
  
  * Select the output dir of the test report
  * Change how the test progress is displayed
  * Modify how _JUnitPlatform_ will behave by directly accessing the _JunitPlatform_ API 

### `JkTestSelection` 

This is the object passed as an argument of `JkTestProcessor#launch` to determine which test to launch. 

It can be set using file or tag filters. It is also possible to code against  _JunitPlatform_ API (example [here](https://github.com/jerkar/jeka/blob/master/samples/dev.jeka.samples.junit5/jeka/jeka-src/Junit5Custom.java)).

### `JkTestResult` 

The result of a test launch. It provides count for tests found, failure, skip, success ...


## Package `dev.jeka.core.api.project`

This is the Jeka high-level API to build Java/JVM projects. API classes belong to  `dev.jeka.core.api.project` [package](https://github.com/jerkar/jeka/tree/master/dev.jeka.core/src/main/java/dev/jeka/core/api/project).

It introduces the concept of `JkProject` from where it performs compilation, testing, resources processing, packaging, publication, and more.
`JkProject` is the root of a deep structure embracing the *parent-chaining* pattern for readability.

The API contains a lot of extension points to add specific behaviors.

### Project Structure 
``` title="JkProject structure"

|  +- mavenSpecificInfo
|  +- methods : publish(), getVersion(), getModuleId()
+ methods :  toDependency(transitivity), getIdeSupport(), pack(), getDependenciesAsXml(), includeLocalAndTextDependencies()           
```

For convenience, `JkProject` provides a facade in order to make common settings friendly,
without navigating deep into the structure. From facade, you can
setup dependencies, java version, project layout, test behavior, test selection and publication.

```Java
JkProject.of().flatFacade()
   .configureCompileDependencies(deps -> deps
           .and("com.google.guava:guava:21.0")
           .and("com.sun.jersey:jersey-server:1.19.4")
           .and("org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter-engine:5.6.0"))
   .configureRuntimeDependencies(deps -> deps
           .minus("org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter-engine")
           .and("com.github.djeang:vincer-dom:1.2.0"))
   .configureTestDependencies(deps -> deps
           .and("org.junit.vintage:junit-vintage-engine:5.6.0"))
   .addTestExcludeFilterSuffixedBy("IT", false)
   .setJavaVersion(JkJavaVersion.V8)
   .setPublishedModuleId("dev.jeka:sample-javaplugin")
   .setPublishedVersion("1.0-SNAPSHOT");

```

If the fa√ßade is not sufficient to set up the project build, you can use the main API.
`JkProject` instances are highly configurable.

Here is a pretty complete example inspired from the [Jeka Build Class](https://github.com/jerkar/jeka/blob/master/core/jeka/def/dev/jeka/core/CoreBuild.java) .

### Dependencies

Project dependencies are managed differently than in Maven/Gradle. Instead of defining 
a single collection of dependencies, each bounded for a specific scope/configuration, 
Jeka projects define 3 distinct classpaths : compile, runtime and test.

Each classpath defines its own set of dependencies independently, though they are defined relatively to each other.

*Compile classpath :* is defined using `project.getCompilation().configureDependencies()`.

*Runtime classpath :* is defined from *Compile Classpath*. This base can be modified using `project.packaging.configureDependencies()`.

*Test classpath :* is defined from a merge of *Compile Classpath* and *Runtime Classpath*. This base can be modified 
using `project.getTesing().getCompilation().configureDependencies()`

#### Full Text Description

An entire project dependency set can be declared with full text description.

By default, if a file named `project-dependencies.txt` is present in *[PROJECT_DIR]/jeka*, this content is taken 
in account to specify project dependencies.

Dependencies have to be declared with the format `group:module:[classifier]:[type]:[version]` where *classifier*, *type* and *version' are optional.  
See `JkCoordinate.of(String description)* for details.

To import *bill-of-materials* (aka *BOM*) just declare a dependency as 'group:module::pom:version'

Symbols `@` and `@@` can be used to mention dependency exclusions.

!!! example

    ```
    == COMPILE ==
    org.lwjgl:lwjgl-bom::pom:3.3.1   # Use lwjgl BOM so we don't need to specify lwjgl versions afterward
    org.lwjgl:lwjgl:natives-linux::  # specify the 'natives-linux' classifier for lwjgl
    org.projectlombok:lombok:1.16.16  

    == RUNTIME ==
    org.postgresql:postgresql:42.5.0
    - org.projectlombok:lombok       # remove lombok from runtime dependencies 

    == TEST ==
    org.seleniumhq.selenium:selenium-chrome-driver:3.4.0
    org.fluentlenium:fluentlenium-junit:3.2.0
    @ org.apache.httpcomponents:httpclient  # exclude http-client from fluentlenium-junit transitive dependencies
    org.fluentlenium:fluentlenium-assertj:3.2.0
    @@ net.sourceforge.htmlunit:htmlunit    # exclude htmlunit from all transitive dependencies

    ```

`== COMPILE ==`  
Defines dependencies that will constitute the *compile* classpath.

`== RUNTIME ==`  
Defines dependencies that will constitute the *runtime* classpath.  
The dependencies will be the ones declared in the *== COMPILE ==* section plus the ones declared in the *== RUNTIME ==* section.  
If dependencies declared in the *== compile ==* section should not be included for the *runtime* classpath, they should 
be explicitly removed using the '-' symbol.


`== TEST ==`  
Defines dependencies that will constitute the *test* classpath.
The dependencies will be the ones declared in the *== COMPILE ==* or *== RUNTIME ==* sections (merge) plus the ones declared in the *== TEST ==* section.

### Publication

Projects can be published on binary repositories (as Maven or Ivy) using `project.getPubliication().publish()`.
When this method is invoked, all artifacts defined in the projects are published. 
Artifacts can be binary, sources, javadoc, or any kind of file.

When published on a repository, a metadata file is generated mentioning moduleId, version and transitive 
dependencies. 

Transitive dependencies are inferred from *compile* and *runtime* dependencies declared for the project, though they 
can be modified programmatically using `project.getPublication().getMaven().configureDependencies()`
and `project.getPublication().getIvy().configureDependencies()` respectively.
