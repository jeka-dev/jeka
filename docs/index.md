# Welcome to Jeka

_Jeka_ is a general purpose build tool, that is designed to be a library and an automation engine. 

Users simply write build logic in Java or Kotlin, then they can invoke their code directly from the command line : Java/Kotlin classes become first class citizen build-scripts !!!

This approach provides several benefits that developers love : _flexibility, lightness, transparency, discoverability_ and _extendability._ 

In addition, Jeka tries to keep its cognitive load low, introducing a minimal set of concepts. Good skills in Java/Kotiln should be 
enough to achieve builds of any complexity.

Last but not least, _Jeka_ is very lightweight (less than 1Mb) and has zero dependencies, making it user-friendly as a simple library.
