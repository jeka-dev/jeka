# Build Base

In this tutorial, we'll use the `base` KBean to build a Java application or library. 

This mode provides a layout between a single-file style like _JBang_ and a full _Maven/Gradle_ [project](build-projects.md).

**Prerequisite:** Jeka must be [installed](../installation.md).

!!! tip
    Run `jeka base: --doc` to see all available options.

## Scaffold a New Code Base

Run `jeka base: scaffold scaffold.kind=APP` to create a base structure, ready for you to start coding right away.

You’ll get the following project structure:
```
. 
├── jeka-src             <- Source root directory
│   ├── _dev             <- Optional package containing all non-prod (build and test)
│   │   ├── test
│   │   └── Build.java  
│   └── app              <- Sugested base package for production code/resources
│       └── App.java     
├── jeka-output          <- Generated dir where artifacts as jars, classes, reports or doc are generated
├── jeka.properties      <- Build configuration  (Java and jeka version, kben configurations, ...)
└── README.md            <- Describes available build commands
```

All your Java code is supposed to be in the *jeka-src* folder.

`_dev` is a special package for source code and dependencies used only for development (e.g., tests, builds).
If you're new to Java, you can ignore or delete it.

The scaffolded example includes an *App* class in the *app* package.  
You can add or modify classes in any package you like.

## Sync with IntelliJ

Run: `jeka intellij: iml --force` to sync the project with IntelliJ.  
If changes don't appear in IntelliJ, go to the project's root directory, then run: `jeka intellij: initProject`.

## Add Dependencies

The *App.java* class declares a `@JkDep` annotation to reference a library. You can add as many libraries as needed.
A good practice is to declare all libraries in the same base class.

```java
@JkDep("com.github.lalyos:jfiglet:0.0.9")
@JkDep("com.fasterxml.jackson:jackson-bom::pom:2.18.2")
@JkDep("com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-core")
@JkDep("com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-annotations")
public class App {
    ...
}
```

See [details on dependency notations](../reference/api-dependency-management.md#string-notation).

Additionally, you can copy-paste JAR files into the following directory to automatically include them as dependencies:
```
├── jeka-boot      <- Jars included in the production classpath.
```

*Declare non-prod dependencies*

Declare dependency on any class under `_dev` package, to add dependency with embedding them 
in production.

```java
import sun.lwawt.macosx.CWarningWindow;

@JkDep("org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter:5.11.4")
@JkDep("org.mockito:mockito-junit-jupiter:5.15.2")
class Build extends KBean {
    ...
}
```

!!! reminder
    Don't forget to run `jeka intellij: iml` once you have modified the dependencies.

## Run your Application

The application can be run using: 
```shell
jeka --program arg0 args1 ... # or `jeka -p` for short
```
To clean compilation before starting, use `--clean` option (`-c` for short).

If ths source code is hosted in a Git repo, the application can be directly executed by referencing the repo as:
```shell
jeka --remote [git repo url] --program arg0 arg1 ... # or jeka -r [git repo url] -p
```

## Make it Native

To compile in native, execute:
```
jeka native: compile
```
When done, execution of `jeka --program ...` will run the native version instead of the Java one.

!!! notes
    You may set this properties if your application needs some resources to run
    ```properties
    @native.includeAllResources=true
    ```


If you want to force native build, set the following property:
```properties title="jeka.properties"
jeka.program.build=native: compile
```

## Dockerize

If you want to create a Docker image of your application, execute:
```shell
jeka docker: build
```
This creates a Docker image based and registers it on your local Docker daemon. 
The console output explains how to execute it.

To create a Docker image based on native executable, execute:
```shell
jeka docker: buildNative
```

## Pre-defined Build Commands

``` title="From *base* KBean"
jeka base: test       # Runs tests
jeka base: pack       # Runs tests + creates jars
jeka base: runJar     # Runs the jar generated by the above command
jeka base: info       # Displays project configuration info
jeka base: depTree    # Displays dependency trees 
```

See [here](/tutorials/build-projects/#pre-defined-build-commands) for extra commands.

## Create a Library

If you want to write a library, instead of an application, you need to declare 
both *moduleId* and versioning.

The settings are similar for [project building](/tutorials/build-projects/#handle-versioning). Use 'base' instead of 'project', like this:

```property
@base.moduleId=org.example:my-lib
@base.version=1.0.0-SNAPSHOT
```

Now, you can publish your library by executing:
```shell
jeka maven: publish
```
